Open ```Program.cs``` and find the method ```SetUpAccounts```

Change the mnemonics as per guidance:

```csharp
        private static void SetUpAccounts(out Account creator, out Account user, out Account user2)
        {
            //This boilerplate sets up some accounts. If using Sandbox, please use the following commands to replace the below mnemonics:
            //   ./sandbox goal account list
            //and for each account:
            //   ./sandbox goal account export -a <address from above list>

            string creatorMnemonic = "blast enable inside tumble trigger rich trust wreck buyer tool athlete idea dawn volume joke maze include work unhappy game lesson vault language ability prepare";
            string userMnemonic = "noise yard remind exotic spy save express stage float ticket gather oval clever local donor miracle elbow fault champion virus rain nature discover abandon employ";
            string user2Mnemonic = "genius genuine bread weekend rigid wild layer crumble delay tennis again popular glove across fever since space display gift upset dust close chunk ability chapter";

            //get accounts based on the above private keys using the .NET SDK
            creator = new Account(creatorMnemonic);
            user = new Account(userMnemonic);
            user2 = new Account(user2Mnemonic);
        }

```


Make sure Sandbox is running, build and execute using F5.
